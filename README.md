# Spark @ BigDataBe Meetup Group

Slides and material for the presentation on Spark for the Meetup Group on 9/7/2014.

Slides are created using `Markdown` and converted to `reveal.js` using `pandoc`. 

I'm trying to host this off github pages, but that has been unsuccesful until now. The best way to view the slides is by cloning the repo and opening `slides.html`.

The `slides.pdf` is a PDF version is an export or the `reveal.js` presentation.
